<h1>Musho</h1>
<div class="multi-col vertical-rhythm">
  <p>Musho Architecture &amp; Design needed a portfolio website. The firm has a wonderful collection of work with many impressive interior photographs.</p>
  <p>The goal of the portfolio was to give a flexible template system that organized text, photos, and project meta data in predictable, but varied ways to keep things looking fresh. We came up with a number of templates that could take different numbers of images and varied amounts of text. We also dedicated the home page to a revolving slide show of highlight photos and projects.</p>
