<h1>RT Enterprises</h1>
<div class="two-col vertical-rhythm">
  <p>RT Enterprises is a consultancy that works with corporate clients so the logo I designed needed to show the professionalism with which Rebecca works.</p>
  <p>Rebecca described that she identified with the bear. This made me think of a bear's instinct to protect its family and how RT Enterprises protects its clients in a similar way.</p>
