<h1>Wedding Invitation</h1>
<div class="two-col vertical-rhythm">
  <p>This project was surprisingly difficult because it's always hard to be your own client. Something about the Cobbler's children&hellip;</p>
  <p>Alycia and I knew we wanted to be very floral with our motif so we bought a lot of flowers from a local florist, and set up a home photo shoot with some scrap wood as a background. The main goal of the project was to have a very elegant invitation that spoke to the formal nature of the event. This was also important to stress that even though it took place on October 31, it was <em>not</em> going to be a costume party.</p>
